### Finding Focus: Paul Thompson's Coding Portfolio

I'm currently building out my findingfocus.dev website in HTML and CSS. There's now a playable demo on that site in the interactive art tab for you to try out and it even works on mobile.
<br>
I'm currently mainly programming interactive art experiences in LOVE 2d using Lua, but I am also programming in C.
